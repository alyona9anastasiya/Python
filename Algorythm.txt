Task about CATS:

1. We have number_of_cats and number_of round
2. Create a new list to put here cats_in_hat
3. Iterate through round: for i in range(rounds):
4. Iterate through cats: for k in range (cats):
5. We can calculate how to iterate every round----->
		if cats % rounds == 0:
		THEN we put that element in cats_in_hat - if it's not here
6. Then printing our list

Complexity - O(2 ^ n) + 2*O(n)
